# My progress in a JavaScript course

The JavaScript course I took is provided by [Cod3r](https://www.cod3r.com.br/) and it's available [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-funcional/). 

# Projects

## Most used words
The first project in the course consists of an algorithm that measures the frequency of words used in a TV show. 

For this, the program takes as input the name of a directory filled with the TV show's subtitles in the `.srt` format. The output is a `JSON` file with the words used and their frequency: 

``` JSON
{
 "word": "i",
 "count": 2491
},
{
 "word": "you",
 "count": 2414
},
{
 "word": "the",
 "count": 2216
},
...
```
